/**
 * Shared chrome for every how2getrich screen.
 *
 * Layout model:
 *   - Stage (540px) is mx-auto centered on the viewport so the
 *     wordmark, spine, and textarea sit perfectly on the vertical
 *     midline regardless of viewport width.
 *   - Sidebar is absolutely positioned 100px to the LEFT of the stage's
 *     left edge using `right-full mr-[100px]` — it floats next to the
 *     stage without ever pushing it off-center.
 *   - rightRail (optional) is positioned absolutely against the viewport
 *     right edge for screens 2/3.
 *
 * On viewports narrower than ~1100px the sidebar clips off the left
 * — hidden behind `md:block` so it disappears cleanly on tablets.
